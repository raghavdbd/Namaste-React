   --------------------------Igniting Our App ---------------------------------------------------------------------


   Parcel(Bundler)

   Create React App is using Webpack as a bundler but we are going to use a parcel bundler

   There are lot of packages are required to make production ready App

   NPm -> Npm is use to manage packages
   package.json -? This file is configuration for npm

   Bundler:
   This manage all our html css and js file so that it can minification 
   there are two type of dependencies
   1. Normal dependencies: dependencies which are require in production 
   2. Dev Dependencies :packages which are require only in devlopment phase we download them as a dev dependencies
     1. (^)==creat this mean if there is update verson then it will automatically updated it(minor version)
     2. (~)==tilde this mean if there is update verson then it will automatically updated it(major version)



     package-lock.json :-  it kepp the record of exact version
     node-modules :- contains all the code the we fetch from Npm

     transitive Dependenct: see we have a dependency on parcel but pract also have some dependency on other package that is known as 
     transitive dependency

    we always put nodemodule in .gitignore
    package and package.lock make maintain of the the dependency which we need with it wee can regenerate node module
     
     npx parcel index.html :- use  to build our App
     npx:- npm execute


   Cdn is not aprefer way to to bring react

    insted use npm to install react
