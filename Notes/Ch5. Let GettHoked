React Hooks -they are just normal javascript function


Use State-> This Hook is used to creare react type of variable or we can say that state type of variable
import UseState from react
this is called state variable because it maintain the stae of your comonent
const [nameofvariable,setname]=useState(whatever we pass here it will be the default value of variable)
1.name of variable,
2.function name to set the variable // this is used to modify the list 
State type  variable help us to keep sync ui with data
Whenever the State variable updated react variable rerender the components
